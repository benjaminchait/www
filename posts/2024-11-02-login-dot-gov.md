Yesterday marked the end of another chapter in my career: I finished my role as a product manager at Login.gov, having spending the past two-and-a-half years leading digital identity efforts and building for the public.

Let me start by stating the obvious: Building digital products is hard. Delivering technology in government is hard. Digital identity is hard.

And yet, it’s incredibly important and impactful work. In any given day, the products that I supported saw more usage than most startups might see in a given month – or year. If you want to put a small dent in the universe, delivering in government offers at a scale that few other organizations can reach. A small change that saves an individual user a few taps or clicks might not be terribly impactful to that one person; but when viewed at the level that government services operate, those changes add up and begin to impact the time tax and reduce the administrative burden in a non-trivial manner. Delivering products and services that make interacting with government easier, faster, and better helps build trust with the public. The work is hard, but it is so very meaningful.

I often remind myself (and my teams) that it’s important to celebrate every win, no matter how small — because getting things done (in government) can be incredibly difficult. We have so many stakeholders, so many requirements. Like any digital product, the work will never be “finished.” Every step forward represents progress.

I’m grateful to have worked with such passionate, talented individuals who truly care about improving the public’s experience with government. We all deserve better digital services, and – as a member of the public – I’m rooting for everyone who chooses to serve.
