Where does one begin?

One day when I’m asked to describe the year 2020, I’ll quietly describe all of the unexpected and challenging moments; and how they made me who I am today. 

While this year has been hard, it’s also been pretty magical for me and the pup. New adventures, new sights, new people. Before the world stopped, I took a week in Italy and New York. Since then, I’ve been working from home like many; but of all the places to call home, California has been a spectacular spot for weekend camping trips and new adventures.
