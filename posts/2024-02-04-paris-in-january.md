I spent two weeks in Paris while Cara taught a study abroad course. It was delightful! Lots of croissants, coffee, art, walking — generally just wandering and exploring.

We spent a weekend in Alsace, a wine region in eastern France near the German border. Strasbourg had some amazingly filling food; Colmar was idyllic; and we wandered through Eguisheim, a tiny village with plenty of small shops and family vineyards.

Back in Paris, we found a Van Gough exhibit at the Musée d’Orsay; learned how to bake croissants (and enjoyed tasting them!); I took a day-trip to Normandy to explore Mont Saint-Michel; we explored an exhibition on Mark Rothko; and otherwise wandered the streets eating crepes in search of museums.
