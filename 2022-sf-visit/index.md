# SF visit

_last updated 18 april 2022_

**When**: Sunday, 1 May 2022

**Where**: San Francisco [Crosstown Trail](https://crosstowntrail.org/)

**What**: We’re back in SF for a brief moment, and want to see friends! We’re planning to hike the Crosstown Trail (~17 miles total) starting around 8 am Pacific at Candlestick Park and ending mid-afternoon at Lands End.

* You can join for as little or as much as you want!
  * The last time we did this, the trek took just over 7 hours and we finished mid-afternoon.
  * We expect our pace to be a little slower this time, and would probably expect to ‘finish’ around 4 pm or so. Think: Friends, food, enjoying the day.
* The morning-of, we can share our iPhone location (using [Find My](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210514)) so you can follow-along and join whenever makes the most sense for you.
  * You can also tell us where you want to meet, and we can exchange text messages or whatnot to coordinate.
  * We expect stops near Glen Park for breakfast; the Inner Sunset (or Golden Gate Park) for lunch; and Lands End for a beverage. Snacks and lots of coffee along the way.
* Weather could change these plans, so keep an eye out for updates (and/or just keep in touch with one of us).
