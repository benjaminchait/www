<p>I’m a product manager and a writer with an interest using technology to help people create better habits, with a particular focus on financial wellness. I help build and scale tech organizations, and recently moved to Chicago with my best friend Lyra.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m consulting and am open to new work. You can learn more <a href="/about">about me</a> and I’d be delighted to chat!</p>
