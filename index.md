<p>Hey there, I’m <a href="/about">Benjamin</a>. I build and scale tech organizations, and empower teams to deliver meaningful outcomes.</p>

<p>I’ve built products loved by millions, developed and operated financial and identity solutions at scale, and led innovative teams to deliver new capabilities. I’m broadly interested in how we use technology to improve everyday lives; and care deeply about the intersection of privacy, security, and trust.</p>
