<p>Hey there, I’m <a href="/about">Benjamin</a>. I build and scale tech organizations, and empower teams to deliver meaningful outcomes.</p>

<p>I’ve built products loved by millions, helped create a digital bank providing better access to credit, and developed platforms to enable new capabilities. While much of my work has focused on improving financial well-being, I’m broadly interested in how we use technology to improve everyday lives.</p>
