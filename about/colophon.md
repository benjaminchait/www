🏗 This site is an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)-based, statically generated site. A [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) build pipeline automatically publishes from the [source repository](https://github.com/benjaminchait/www). The domain name is registered via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Some more history about me on the web [is described in GitHub](https://github.com/benjaminchait/www/blob/main/README.md).

🎨 The CSS and layouts were mine originally; then were updated based heavily on [Clio](https://github.com/danromero/clio); and have continued receiving my own modifications (such as 🌑 dark mode support).

📷 All content and imagery is mine.

📊 Analytics are handled through [Plausible](https://plausible.io); which feels like the best balance between user privacy and understanding what content is being viewed.

👋 Feel free [to say hi](/about) with questions, I’m always happy and eager to help if I can!
