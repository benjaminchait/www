🏗 This site is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-based, statically generated site. A [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) build pipeline automatically publishes from the [source repository](https://github.com/benjaminchait/www). The domain name is registered via [Google Domains](https://domains.google).

🎨 The CSS and layouts were mine, then were updated based heavily on [Clio](https://github.com/danromero/clio), and have continued receiving modifications (such as dark mode support).

📈 Basic analytics are captured using [Plausible](https://plausible.io/). They’re simple, and I believe they maintain a nice balance between providing some traffic insights to me; while not tracking personally identifiable details of yours across the internet.

📷 All content and imagery is mine.

👋 Feel free [to say hi](/about) with questions, I’m always happy and eager to help if I can!
