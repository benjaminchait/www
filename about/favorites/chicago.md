### Hyde Park
- 🥐 [Plein Air Cafe](https://maps.apple.com/?address=5751%20S%20Woodlawn%20Ave,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060637,%20United%20States&auid=17317106175298295220&ll=41.790073,-87.595961&lsp=9902&q=Plein%20Air%20Cafe%20%26%20Eatery) has pastries, coffee, and awesome breakfasts. The outside patio is lovely in the summer!
- 🍳 For a unique breakfast experience, [Valois](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1518%20E%2053rd%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060615,%20United%20States&auid=253610903345179947&ll=41.799759,-87.588356&lsp=9902&q=Valois) offers a distinctly-Hyde Park experience. This “cafeteria-style diner” is a little bit of a local institution. It’s cash-only, and can be a bit overwhelming on your first visit - but that’s part of the fun. The menu includes some of Barack Obama’s favorites, and is a delightful spot of local history.
- ☕️ [True North](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1323%20E%2057th%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060637,%20United%20States&auid=18285316051256051375&ll=41.791278,-87.593841&lsp=9902&q=TrueNorth%20Cafe%20Hyde%20Park) has good breakfast sandwiches and coffee. When the weather is nice, they have a garage-style door that opens the space up to 57th Street.
- 🍝 Our favorite local dinner spot is [Ascione Bistro](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1500%20E%2055th%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060615,%20United%20States&auid=10674875566085671605&ll=41.795348,-87.588721&lsp=9902&q=Ascione%20Bistro). This Italian restaurant has excellent meals, including their homemade pasta. We’ve always had a great time.
- 🥘 [Mahari](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1504%20E%2055th%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060615,%20United%20States&coordinate=41.795443,-87.588797&name=Mahari&place-id=IEF93CFA5A17A9A9D&map=explore) is a delightful new restaurant serving a variety of African cuisine. The atmosphere and the food are amazing.
- 🍕 [Medici](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1327%20E%2057th%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060637,%20United%20States&coordinate=41.791341,-87.593672&name=Medici%20on%2057th&place-id=I6DE71373D631379A&map=explore) is a local classic with a good variety of food. During the warmer months, they’ve got a nice upstairs patio. Their bakery also has plenty of goods, and you can order their main restaurant food for take-away.
- 💦 [Promontory Point](https://maps.apple.com/?address=5491%20S.%20Jean-Baptiste%20Pointe%20DuSable%20Lake%20Shore%20Drive,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060615,%20United%20States&auid=3043761696410100050&ll=41.795928,-87.577525&lsp=9902&q=Promontory%20Point) is good for a walk, and excellent for a picnic or beverage. It’s also our starting point for 🚲 biking the Lake Front Trail ([southern end](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Chicago,%20IL%2060611,%20United%20States&auid=4186466711766065665&ll=41.766320,-87.562720&lsp=9902&q=Lakefront%20Trail), [northern end](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Chicago,%20IL%2060611,%20United%20States&auid=7709229080613504211&ll=41.986591,-87.653997&lsp=9902&q=Lakefront%20Trail)).
- 🐌 [Snail Thai](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1649%20E%2055th%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060615,%20United%20States&auid=465845548283048612&ll=41.795092,-87.584779&lsp=9902&q=The%20Snail%20Thai%20Cuisine) is our preferred Thai restaurant around. They’re super fast for take away, and everything is delicious.
- 🏛️ [Museum of Science and Industry](https://maps.apple.com/?address=5700%20S%20DuSable%20Lake%20Shore%20Drive,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060637,%20United%20States&auid=3147873044780092380&ll=41.790513,-87.582922&lsp=9902&q=Museum%20of%20Science%20and%20Industry,%20Chicago) is vast, and you can spend hours exploring. During the spring, visit the 🌸 cherry blossoms which are scattered around the south edge of the museum (no need for an entrance ticket).
- 🎓 The [University of Chicago](https://maps.apple.com/?address=5801%20S%20Ellis%20Ave,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060637,%20United%20States&auid=222360845964844126&ll=41.792103,-87.600220&lsp=9902&q=University%20of%20Chicago) has a beautiful campus, and you can walk through it to see the 📐 [Robie House](https://maps.apple.com/?address=5757%20S%20Woodlawn%20Ave,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060637,%20United%20States&auid=374072806549190790&ll=41.789811,-87.595928&lsp=9902&q=Frederick%20C.%20Robie%20House), the 🏛️ [Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1155%20E%2058th%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060637,%20United%20States&auid=13845425828580820919&ll=41.789409,-87.597449&lsp=9902&q=Institute%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Ancient%20Cultures), or simply enjoy the 🦆 duck pond.

### West Loop

<!-- now closed
- 🪶 [Roister](https://maps.apple.com/?address=951%20W%20Fulton%20Market,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060607,%20United%20States&auid=4409570904384129369&ll=41.886599,-87.651810&lsp=9902&q=Roister) is also part of Alinea and is known for their delicious fried 🍗 chicken.
-->
- 🕖 [Time Out Fulton Market](https://maps.apple.com/?address=916%20W%20Fulton%20Market,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060607,%20United%20States&auid=15044358521693904204&ll=41.886920,-87.650530&lsp=9902&q=Time%20Out%20Market) is a multi-story food hall with lots of options.
- ☕️ [Sawada coffee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=112%20N%20Green%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060607,%20United%20States&auid=15228306671429377085&ll=41.883640,-87.648788&lsp=9902&q=Sawada%20Coffee) has some great matcha drinks, and the “military latte” is excellent.
- 🥙 [Aba](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=302%20N%20Green%20St,%20FL%203,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060607,%20United%20States&coordinate=41.887025,-87.648903&name=Aba&place-id=I17C3DDB193122959&map=explore) is our go-to for late afternoon happy hours and mediterranean food.
- 🥙 [Lýra](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=905%20W%20Fulton%20Market%0AChicago,%20IL%2060607%0AUnited%20States&coordinate=41.886572,-87.650076&name=L%C3%9DRA&place-id=I3D58F8196F06F5&map=explore) is an excellent Greek restaurant which serves “family style.”
- 🍜 We dropped by [Kinton Ramen](https://maps.apple.com/?address=163%20N%20Sangamon%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060607,%20United%20States&auid=4906119005532631732&ll=41.884928,-87.650711&lsp=9902&q=Kinton%20Ramen) while wandering the neighborhood and loved the food and drink.
- 🐐 For some city views with your drinks or meal, [Cabra](https://maps.apple.com/?address=200%20N%20Green%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060607,%20United%20States&auid=10449723616408104591&ll=41.885881,-87.649108&lsp=9902&q=Cabra) is an excellent vantage point. The inside can get loud, so we prefer the patio.

### Loop
- The [Chicago Riverwalk](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2%20N%20La%20Salle%20St,%20Floor%202,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060602,%20United%20States&auid=17426554822183736752&ll=41.887272,-87.627236&lsp=9902&q=Chicago%20Riverwalk) is a great area to enjoy 🍷 some beverages and snacks, or as a starting point to ⛴️ take an architectural boat tour and learn about the city and its history.
- If you have a couple of hours, join a free 🚶‍♂️ walking tour from the [Chicago Cultural Center](https://maps.apple.com/?address=78%20E%20Washington%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060602,%20United%20States&auid=6067168364543969049&ll=41.883576,-87.624948&lsp=9902&q=Chicago%20Cultural%20Center) and you get to explore all sorts of buildings and learn about Chicago history!
- 🐬 The [Shedd Aquarium](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1200%20S%20Dusable%20Lake%20Shore%20Dr,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060605,%20United%20States&auid=6135812639410860302&ll=41.867579,-87.613606&lsp=9902&q=Shedd%20Aquarium) is always fun, or explore the 🏛️ [Field Museum](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1400%20S%20Dusable%20Lake%20Shore%20Dr,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060605,%20United%20States&auid=2027249941338592107&ll=41.866109,-87.617029&lsp=9902&q=Field%20Museum) and find 🦖 “Sue” the dinosaur!

### North
- 🥐 We love the pastries, 🥖 baguettes, and sourdough bread at [Floriole](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1220%20W%20Webster%20Ave,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060614,%20United%20States&auid=10466231550611170415&ll=41.921849,-87.659204&lsp=9902&q=Floriole)--this is an absolute treasure of a spot, and my only complaint is that it’s a small trek from Hyde Park.
- 🍳 My best brunch is [Lula Cafe](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2537%20N%20Kedzie%20Blvd,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060647,%20United%20States&auid=5142171322749906622&ll=41.927621,-87.706752&lsp=9902&q=Lula%20Cafe) in Logan Square. They open at 9 am--be in line by 8:45 am to get a table on their first seating!
- 🍕 Our date-night pizza is [Spacca Napoli](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1769%20W%20Sunnyside%20Ave,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060640,%20United%20States&auid=6915981325229687812&ll=41.963220,-87.673636&lsp=9902&q=Spacca%20Napoli%20Pizzeria). They offer Napoli-style (wood-fired oven) pizza and their summertime patio feels like a night out in Rome. Grab some drinks and appetizers and enjoy the neighborhood!
- 🥯 For a quick meal, weekend breakfast bagel sandwiches at [Steingold’s Deli](https://maps.apple.com/?address=3737%20N%20Southport%20Ave,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060613,%20United%20States&auid=14091099803264601718&ll=41.950039,-87.663785&lsp=9902&q=Steingold%E2%80%99s) are quite filling.
- 🍕 Another place to take friends is the deep-dish pizza at [Pequod’s Pizza](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2207%20N%20Clybourn%20Ave,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060614,%20United%20States&auid=8543306803376454292&ll=41.921831,-87.664508&lsp=9902&q=Pequod's%20Pizza). While we’ve tried it as a take-away, we very much prefer eating-in with friends--grab a pitcher of beer and enjoy!
- 🍕 When the weather is nice, grabbing a patio spot at [Robert’s Pizza and Dough Co.](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=465%20N%20McClurg%20Ct,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060611,%20United%20States&coordinate=41.890821,-87.617088&name=Robert%E2%80%99s&place-id=I4A1B91558D99C043&map=explore) is fun!
- 🦁 Whenever we have some free time up north, the [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2001%20N.%20Clark%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060614,%20United%20States&auid=12760104372783582348&ll=41.920896,-87.633004&lsp=9902&q=Lincoln%20Park%20Zoo) is a fun (and free!) place to watch the wildlife.

### South (Indiana)
- 🏝️ Visit the [Indiana Dunes](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1600%20N%2025%20E,%20Chesterton,%20IN%2046304,%20United%20States&coordinate=41.659335,-87.063051&name=Indiana%20Dunes%20State%20Park&place-id=IBBB8C3CBB9C7B4F7&map=explore) for some outdoor recreation, and some views of Chicago from across the lake!
- 👹 We had an overnight camping trip and got dinner at [Goblin and the Grocer](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1%20W%20Dunes%20Hwy%0ABeverly%20Shores,%20IN%20%2046301%0AUnited%20States&coordinate=41.672134,-86.985744&name=Goblin%20%26%20The%20Grocer&place-id=IE893BD9EB63944D&map=explore). They had an excellent food and drink menu, and it was walking distance to our campsite.
- 🍳 On another trip, our friends recommended [Third Coast Spice Cafe](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=761%20Indian%20Boundary%20Rd,%20Unit%206,%20Chesterton,%20IN%2046304,%20United%20States&coordinate=41.617274,-87.037207&name=Third%20Coast%20Spice%20Cafe&place-id=I1E7CF35696BA8D4D&map=explore) which was a delicious diner-style breakfast.

### Beyond

They have daily specials posted on the wall. The indoor restaurant is fun, and they have a large patio out back. Obviously, get the rotisserie duck.
- ⚾️ Watch a ball game with the White Sox (at [Guaranteed Rate Field](https://maps.apple.com/?address=333%20W%2035th%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%2060616,%20United%20States&auid=1582473545085192272&ll=41.829811,-87.633577&lsp=9902&q=Guaranteed%20Rate%20Field)) or the Cubs (at [Wrigley Field](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1060%20W%20Addison%20St,%20Chicago,%20IL%20%2060613,%20United%20States&auid=16246086688498290818&ll=41.948224,-87.655460&lsp=9902&q=Wrigley%20Field)).
- 🌳 Wandering the [Morton Arboretum](https://maps.apple.com/?address=4100%20Illinois%20Route%2053,%20Lisle,%20IL%2060532,%20United%20States&auid=862481568325447181&ll=41.817844,-88.065416&lsp=9902&q=The%20Morton%20Arboretum) is a magical outdoor activity (bonus points for 🐶 “tails on the trails” days where dogs are allowed entry).
  - 🥪 While you’re out in the suburbs, grab an Italian-style sandwich from [Pronto Italian Sandwiches](https://maps.apple.com/?address=8%20E%20First%20St,%20Hinsdale,%20IL%20%2060521,%20United%20States&auid=5956782002297531768&ll=41.801399,-87.928786&lsp=9902&q=Pronto%20Italian%20Sandwiches) on the way to (or from) the arboretum!
- 🌻 For more time in nature, visit the [Chicago Botanic Garden](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1000%20Lake%20Cook%20Road,%20Glencoe,%20IL%2060022,%20United%20States&auid=12175092430782721818&ll=42.145200,-87.785832&lsp=9902&q=Chicago%20Botanic%20Garden).
- 🛶 If you’re up north near the Botanic Garden, canoeing in the [Skokie Lagoons](https://maps.apple.com/?address=788%E2%80%93794%20N%20Forest%20Way%20Dr,%20Northbrook,%20IL%20%2060062,%20United%20States&auid=17802024203799305960&ll=42.128866,-87.774922&lsp=9902&q=Skokie%20Lagoons) is a simple and peaceful getaway from the city.
- 🥾 Exploring the [Palos Forest Preserve](https://maps.apple.com/?address=9600%E2%80%939610%20Wolf%20Rd,%20Willow%20Springs,%20IL%20%2060480,%20United%20States&auid=2940417056827028692&ll=41.714355,-87.895142&lsp=9902&q=Palos%20Trail%20System) is especially fun with some snow on the ground.
- 🎤 Look up and attend a [Chicago Humanities](https://www.chicagohumanities.org) event--they host all around the city, and we’ve seen all sorts of incredible speakers.
