_Last updated 26 August 2025._

I lived in SF from 2019 to 2021. I live in Berkeley as of 2025.

### SF
- ‚òïÔ∏è [Wrecking Ball Coffee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2271%20Union%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094123,%20United%20States&auid=15797632476955295124&ll=37.796755,-122.436643&lsp=9902&q=Wrecking%20Ball%20Coffee%20Roasters) is a small shop on Union. They have some simple snacks, but you really visit this spot for their coffee.
- ‚òïÔ∏è I lived one block away from [Saint Frank Coffee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2340%20Polk%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094109,%20United%20States&auid=5105107099428073594&ll=37.798357,-122.422119&lsp=9902&q=Saint%20Frank%20Coffee) on Polk and the coffee and pastries are amazing.
- ‚òïÔ∏è For a more casual spot to meet a friend, [Sightglass Coffee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=301%20Divisadero%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094117,%20United%20States&auid=11327320202390494766&ll=37.772303,-122.437528&lsp=9902&q=Sightglass%20Coffee) on Divisadero is great. I think this is their second spot (with [the original](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=270%207th%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094103,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.776974,-122.408529&name=Sightglass%20Coffee&place-id=I594FECA0B369D14A&map=explore) in SOMA).
- ‚òïÔ∏è [Flywheel Coffee Roasters](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=672%20Stanyan%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094117,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.769714,-122.453383&name=Flywheel%20Coffee%20Roasters&place-id=IB34D8C6C52436795&map=explore) is my favorite coffee when you‚Äôre about to wander into Golden Gate Park. They‚Äôre on Stanyan facing the park, so once you have your drink you can simply walk across the street and wander.
- üç≥ Get the best breakfast sandwich at [Devil‚Äôs Teeth Baking Company](https://maps.apple.com/?address=3876%20Noriega%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094122,%20United%20States&auid=17922246749675822168&ll=37.753179,-122.504951&lsp=9902&q=Devil%E2%80%99s%20Teeth%20Baking%20Co.); and then grab a üßã snowy plover from [Andytown Coffee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=3655%20Lawton%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094122,%20United%20States&auid=13782962688710535021&ll=37.756661,-122.502226&lsp=9902&q=Andytown%20Coffee%20Roasters); and then wander [Ocean Beach](https://maps.apple.com/?address=San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094132,%20United%20States&auid=9113434404634483650&ll=37.756483,-122.510626&lsp=9902&q=Ocean%20Beach) or [Fort Funston](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Skyline%20Blvd,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094132,%20United%20States&auid=18127498724970457636&ll=37.713829,-122.503889&lsp=9902&q=Fort%20Funston); or really, any combination of the above.
- üåØ When you‚Äôre near North Beach or Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf, [Beacon Coffee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=805%20Columbus%20Ave,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094133,%20United%20States&auid=464328432053712248&ll=37.802235,-122.413327&lsp=9902&q=Beacon%20Coffee%20%26%20Pantry) has my favorite breakfast burrito in town (both a veggie and meat option).
- üç£ [Grandeho‚Äôs Kamekyo Sushi Bar](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=2721%20Hyde%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094109,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.806138,-122.420670&name=Grandeho's%20Kamekyo%20Sushi%20Bar&place-id=I527B699542CED349&map=explore) is a small, hole-in-the-wall spot that I love. When I first moved to the city, this was a block or so away--and a simple go-to for meals.
- ü•ê My new favorite go-to for a croissant (or other delicious pastry) is [Maison Nico](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=710%20Montgomery%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094111,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.795809,-122.403215&name=Maison%20Nico&place-id=IF1A75F6493888C37&map=explore). It‚Äôs a delightful little bakery just a block away from the Transamerica building. You wait outside until they call you in for a very personalized service. If you want, you can sit at one of their tables outside‚Äîbut if you grab your items to-go and walk for a minute, you‚Äôll be at [Transamerica Redwood Park](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=600%20Montgomery%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094111,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.795147,-122.402228&name=Transamerica%20Redwood%20Park&place-id=I9B7DECEA3D0D604D&map=explore) which is a lovely spot with fountains and plenty of amazing trees right in the city.
- ü•ô [Souvla](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=517%20Hayes%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094102,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.776484,-122.425003&name=Souvla&place-id=I8DFD1A121EE51507&map=explore) is a perfect spot for lunch or dinner and serves Greek gyros, salads, and wine. A few locations exist around the city, but this one is my favorite due to its proximity to lots of boutique shops and spots in Hayes Valley.
- ü•ò [Chez Maman](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=401%20Gough%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094102,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.776984,-122.423163&name=Chez%20Maman&place-id=I60D3360E1F9E55F9&map=explore) is a delightful French restaurant right on the corner of Hayes and Gough.
- üç∑ [Verve Wine](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=2358%20Fillmore%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094115,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.791426,-122.434210&name=Verve%20Wine&place-id=I77AC380F4FDB45F8&map=explore) is a fun little wine shop that has lots of great options! I like grabbing something to drink and a few snacks from the shops around it and wandering to [Lafayette Park](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Gough%20and%20Washington%20Street,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094109,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.791413,-122.427907&name=Lafayette%20Park&place-id=I9DCBE18A8294BEDA&map=explore) to enjoy the sunshine (or sunset, depending on the hour).
- ü•ê [Tartine](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=600%20Guerrero%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094110,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.761447,-122.423979&name=Tartine%20Bakery&place-id=IC3CACACBE6503201&map=explore) always has a line and has always been worth the wait. If you grab pastries, bring them to [Mission Dolores Park](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=566%20Dolores%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094110,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.759765,-122.427108&name=Mission%20Dolores%20Park&place-id=I501E3D5FE2B085EF&map=explore) to enjoy!
- ‚òïÔ∏è My favorite coffee in the Mission District is [Ritual](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1026%20Valencia%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094110,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.756429,-122.421342&name=Ritual%20Coffee%20Roasters&place-id=IE2E78246C93DC350&map=explore).
- üç´ [Dandelion Chocolate](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=740%20Valencia%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094110,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.760974,-122.421738&name=Dandelion%20Chocolate&place-id=I8BA00B158FFDFC5E&map=explore) is lovely.
- ü•ê [Craftsman and Wolves](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=746%20Valencia%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094110,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.760923,-122.421824&name=Craftsman%20And%20Wolves&place-id=IC016B2E33A9BF0F4&map=explore) has amazing pastries.
- üçï When I first moved to the city, [Fiorella](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2238%20Polk%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094109,%20United%20States&auid=6440428275071146082&ll=37.797497,-122.421845&lsp=9902&q=Fiorella) (on Polk, but they have other locations!) was my regular go-to spot for pizza and pasta. I love visiting with a friend and ordering food to share; but have also enjoyed solo visits at the bar.
- üçï For something a bit more, [Little Star Pizza](https://maps.apple.com/?address=846%20Divisadero%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094117,%20United%20States&auid=2550284738671571841&ll=37.777533,-122.438099&lsp=9902&q=Little%20Star%20Pizza) on Divisadero serves some great deep dish.
- üçû I always think of [The Mill](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=736%20Divisadero%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094117,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.776456,-122.437847&name=The%20Mill&place-id=I6CA1CA0594205A2B&map=explore) after [they made headlines](https://www.businessinsider.com/artisanal-toast-san-francisco-craze-2017-6) due to their avocado toast. Having tried it, I think it‚Äôs great!
- ü•ó [Wildseed](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2000%20Union%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094123,%20United%20States&auid=15478624536576708337&ll=37.797617,-122.432439&lsp=9902&q=Wildseed) is a delightful vegetarian spot on Union.
- üå≤ For some time outdoors, exploring [The Presidio](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1750%20Lincoln%20Blvd,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094129,%20United%20States&auid=5907117042203329110&ll=37.796899,-122.465458&lsp=9902&q=Presidio) is always fun.
- üåä [Lands End](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Crosstown%20Trail,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094121,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.785281,-122.506188&name=Lands%20End&place-id=IE30BEFE2898A5DFE&map=explore) is one of my favorite spots in the city, facing out to the Pacific Ocean. Great for a short (or long!) hike and photos of the Sutro Bath ruins.
- üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you have a bit more time, walking the [Crosstown Trail](https://crosstowntrail.org) gives you an appreciation of how big and diverse San Francisco is. We like going east-to-west starting at [Candlestick Park](https://maps.apple.com/?address=San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094124,%20United%20States&auid=16502586621750172044&ll=37.709403,-122.381301&lsp=9902&q=San%20Francisco%20Crosstown%20Trail) and finishing at [Lands End](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Outer%20Richmond,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA,%20United%20States&auid=13171097645209421073&ll=37.780664,-122.511959&lsp=9902&q=Crosstown%20Trail) but you can choose where to start and finish (and which direction to walk). It‚Äôs an urban hike, and we typically grab coffee and snacks along the way; and try to meet friends for a larger lunch around Golden Gate Park.
- üö≤ For another longer adventure, biking the [Golden Gate Bridge](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Golden%20Gate%20Bridge,%20San%20Francisco%20CA,%20United%20States&auid=5260905935154504984&ll=37.818449,-122.478409&lsp=9902&q=Golden%20Gate%20Bridge) is windy but unique--once you make it to Sausalito, grab ‚òïÔ∏è beverage at [Equator](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1201%20Bridgeway,%20Sausalito,%20CA%20%2094965,%20United%20States&auid=14650312616947151539&ll=37.859083,-122.485376&lsp=9902&q=Equator%20Coffees) and enjoy the community. You can then either bike back across the bridge, or take the ferry into the city!
- üåæ SF has great farmer‚Äôs markets, and two of my favorite are [Fort Mason](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Fort%20Mason%20Center,%20Marina%20Blvd,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094109,%20United%20States&auid=5221784282182067150&coordinate=37.805305,-122.431889&lsp=9902&name=Fort%20Mason%20Center%20Farmers'%20Market&map=explore) and the [Ferry Plaza](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Ferry%20Building%20Terminal%0ASan%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094105%0AUnited%20States&coordinate=37.795231,-122.392833&name=Ferry%20Plaza%20Farmers%20Market&place-id=I814CBDCC78CFACC4&map=explore).

### North
- üç∑ We love wine tasting at [Biale](https://maps.apple.com/?address=4038%20Big%20Ranch%20Rd,%20Napa,%20CA%20%2094558,%20United%20States&auid=7692615653725857920&ll=38.350658,-122.300987&lsp=9902&q=Biale%20Vineyards) - make sure you have a reservation, and get a bottle of ‚ÄúBlack Chicken‚Äù (and make sure you get the story).
- ü•æ For some good hiking options, visit the [Marin Headlands](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Sausalito,%20CA%2094965,%20United%20States&auid=1555188781774265847&ll=37.847070,-122.527170&lsp=9902&q=Marin%20Headlands) or drive to [Point Reyes National Seashore](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1%20Bear%20Valley%20Rd,%20Point%20Reyes%20Station,%20CA%2094956,%20United%20States&auid=18433824986773446871&ll=38.043765,-122.869720&lsp=9902&q=Point%20Reyes%20National%20Seashore). Both are spectacular, but beware of both traffic and crowds (especially in Marin, due to its proximity to SF) if you have a late start.
- üå≤ I love redwood trees and [Muir Woods](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1%20Muir%20Woods%20Rd,%20Mill%20Valley,%20CA%20%2094941,%20United%20States&auid=10409377109732512353&ll=37.895921,-122.579699&lsp=9902&q=Muir%20Woods%20National%20Monument) is an accessible way to visit. Make sure you [book ahead](https://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm) for parking!
- ‚õ∞Ô∏è [Mount Tam](https://maps.apple.com/?address=3801%20Panoramic%20Hwy,%20Mill%20Valley,%20CA%20%2094941,%20United%20States&auid=4176385866853242174&ll=37.895108,-122.614202&lsp=9902&q=Mount%20Tamalpais%20State%20Park) has some spectacular views and good hikes.
- ‚õ¥Ô∏è You can take a ferry to [Angel Island State Park](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Sausalito%20CA%2094965,%20United%20States&auid=9090821029790562848&ll=37.862126,-122.430456&lsp=9902&q=Angel%20Island%20State%20Park) for a nice day of local hikes.

- ü•æ [Tilden Regional Park](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2501%20Grizzly%20Peak%20Blvd,%20Orinda,%20CA%2094563,%20United%20States&auid=916792949916813897&ll=37.898833,-122.246075&lsp=9902&q=Tilden%20Regional%20Park) is a great spot for hiking.
