_Last updated 26 August 2024._

I lived here from 2013 to 2019, and loved so many little spots.

- ☕️ Portland is a town with many great coffee options, but my favorite will always be [Heart Coffee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2211%20E%20Burnside%20St,%20Portland,%20OR%2097214,%20United%20States&auid=9079577799699969003&ll=45.523004,-122.643193&lsp=9902&q=Heart) on East Burnside. I lived near this spot for many years, and while they no longer roast beans here, it still has a special place in my heart.
- ☕️ [Barista](https://maps.apple.com/?address=823%20NW%2023rd%20Ave,%20Portland,%20OR%2097210,%20United%20States&auid=11237019928319126106&ll=45.528774,-122.698830&lsp=9902&q=Barista)
- ☕️ [Woodlawn Coffee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=808%20NE%20Dekum%20St,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097211,%20United%20States&auid=11270584199129585823&ll=45.571594,-122.657145&lsp=9902&q=Woodlawn%20Coffee%20and%20Pastry)
- 🍩 The best donuts in town are [Blue Star Donuts](https://maps.apple.com/?address=3325%20SE%20Division%20St,%20Unit%201,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097202,%20United%20States&auid=11204161612495146037&ll=45.504885,-122.631127&lsp=9902&q=Blue%20Star%20Donuts). As a bonus, as of 2024 they had a spot in the PDX airport (airside) if you needed a fix before your flight. (Or a gift for whomever was at your destination...)
- 🍩 [Pip’s Original Donuts](https://maps.apple.com/?address=4759%20NE%20Fremont%20St,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097213,%20United%20States&auid=6799778759693220062&ll=45.548448,-122.613848&lsp=9902&q=Pip's%20Original%20Doughnuts%20%26%20Chai) is a unique take on doughnuts - they’re almost bite-sized, and come in multiple flavors. Pip’s always seems to have a line, but you can order a dozen (or more!) so you can try them all — and they even have chai flights if you’re eating-in!
- [Pine State Biscuits](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2204%20NE%20Alberta%20St,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097211,%20United%20States&auid=3174696719714096824&ll=45.558930,-122.642725&lsp=9902&q=Pine%20State%20Biscuits)
- 🍝 Enjoy a simple Italian dinner at my favorite little restaurant in the city [Luce](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2140%20E%20Burnside%20St,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097214,%20United%20States&auid=18385022728770510638&ll=45.522652,-122.643614&lsp=9902&q=Luce). Their focaccia and house wine is delightful, and I always enjoy ordering a half-serving of one of their hand-made pastas and adding a simple vegetable side.
- 🍕 I once took a friend of mine — who was Italian, and visiting from Italy — to [Dove Vivi](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2727%20NE%20Glisan,%20Portland,%20OR%2097232,%20United%20States&auid=11626900885274609637&ll=45.526705,-122.637687&lsp=9902&q=Dove%20Vivi). They serve pizza with a cornmeal crust, and it is absolutely spectacular. My friend, being the Italian, said something to the extent: “This is good. But is not pizza.” And promptly finished a healthy portion. 🤣
- 🍕 [Pizza Jerk](https://maps.apple.com/?address=5028%20NE%2042nd%20Ave,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097218,%20United%20States&auid=16410937448381942115&ll=45.559395,-122.620195&lsp=9902&q=Pizza%20Jerk)
- 🐓 My favorite “comfort” Thai spot in town is [Paadee](https://maps.apple.com/?address=6%20SE%2028th%20Ave,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097214,%20United%20States&auid=7373440988096002642&ll=45.522695,-122.637111&lsp=9902&q=Paadee). My favorite is the GAI GROP SAM YAN crispy chicken!
- 🐓 [Hat Yai](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1605%20NE%20Killingsworth%20St,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097211,%20United%20States&auid=16841132623740252116&ll=45.562884,-122.648964&lsp=9902&q=Hat%20Yai%20Restaurant)
- 🐓 [Nong’s Kho Man Ghai](https://maps.apple.com/?address=609%20SE%20Ankeny%20St,%20Unit%20C,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097214,%20United%20States&auid=10074551116099932126&ll=45.522370,-122.659386&lsp=9902&q=Nong's%20Khao%20Man%20Gai)
- 🍜 [Afuri](https://maps.apple.com/?address=923%20SE%207th%20Ave,%20Portland,%20OR%20%2097214,%20United%20States&auid=6158893173613371304&ll=45.515974,-122.659044&lsp=9902&q=Afuri%20Izakaya)
- 🍻 beer at [Breakside Brewery](https://maps.apple.com/?address=820%20NE%20Dekum%20St,%20Portland,%20OR%2097211,%20United%20States&auid=23089384799060284&ll=45.571558,-122.656848&lsp=9902&q=Breakside%20Brewery)
- ⚽️ see a Timbers game at [Providence Park](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1844%20SW%20Morrison,%20Portland,%20OR%2097205,%20United%20States&auid=260646893140858031&ll=45.521511,-122.691804&lsp=9902&q=Providence%20Park)
- 🏞️ Take a short drive out to explore the [Columbia River Gorge](https://maps.apple.com/?address=902%20Wasco%20Ave,%20Unit%20200,%20Hood%20River,%20OR%2097031,%20United%20States&auid=17668512798426624431&ll=45.711582,-121.519845&lsp=9902&q=Columbia%20River%20Gorge%20National%20Scenic%20Area). Stop at the [Vista House](https://maps.apple.com/?address=40700%20Historic%20Columbia%20River%20Hwy,%20Corbett,%20OR%2097019,%20United%20States&auid=4560113308687690671&ll=45.539572,-122.244347&lsp=9902&q=Vista%20House) for some amazing views of the Gorge before continuing on to [Multnomah Falls](https://maps.apple.com/?address=53000%20E%20Historic%20Columbia%20River%20Hwy,%20Bridal%20Veil,%20OR%2097010,%20United%20States&auid=5339870131706337991&ll=45.575901,-122.115140&lsp=9902&q=Multnomah%20Falls).
