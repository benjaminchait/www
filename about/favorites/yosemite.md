Yosemite National Park is a special place. It‚Äôs one of the most unique landscapes, and full of icons like Half Dome. The Yosemite Valley is magical, but the park itself is full of wilderness. (On a personal note, Cara and I [got married in the park](/archives/yosemite-wedding).)

### Yosemite Valley
* üèûÔ∏è The [Yosemite Valley](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Southside%20Dr%20%26%20Yosemite%20Valley%20Loop%20Trail,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=9902249752144429275&ll=37.737225,-119.604077&lsp=9902&q=Yosemite%20Valley) itself is extraordinary. You‚Äôre surrounded by granite cliffs a few thousand feet tall, and the Merced River runs down the center. This makes a lovely spot for an in-park lodge stay, and offers a number of amenities and dining options.
* üè® [The Ahwahnee Hotel](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1%20Ahwahnee%20Dr,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=16197676400918435143&ll=37.746218,-119.574310&lsp=9902&q=The%20Ahwahnee%20Hotel) is described as a crown jewel of park lodges. It sits in the valley a short walk from Yosemite Falls, and is a beautiful spot in which to take in the park.
* ü•© [The Mountain Room Restaurant](https://maps.apple.com/?address=9006%20Yosemite%20Lodge%20Dr,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=2370034411666224560&ll=37.743527,-119.598115&lsp=9902&q=Mountain%20Room%20Restaurant) is a great spot for a nice, relatively casual meal located at the Yosemite Valley Lodge.
* üçï For a more relaxed meal, the [Curry Village Pizza Deck](https://maps.apple.com/?address=9010%20Curry%20Village%20Service%20Rd,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=12542205084086810426&ll=37.737365,-119.571317&lsp=9902&q=Curry%20Village%20Pizza%20Deck) has delightful wood-fired pizzas and lots of outdoor patio tables to enjoy an evening meal.
* ü•æ Go for a morning hike up the [Mist Trail](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Mariposa%20County,%20CA,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.726266,-119.530570&name=Mist%20Trail&place-id=I25571980EDFF8691&map=explore). This trail is quite popular, so start early to avoid the crowds! Fortunately, this trail is relatively easy--it does have a number of steps (to get to the top of some waterfalls) but is one of the shorter hikes.
* ü•æ For more of a challenge, try hiking to the top of [Yosemite Falls](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Mariposa%20County,%20CA,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.742811,-119.603290&name=Upper%20Yosemite%20Falls%20Trail&place-id=I6045CC472F070161&map=explore). This trail is very dusty and steep! But your views of the Valley are lovely once you reach the top!
* üå≤ Anyone in your group who doesn‚Äôt want the challenge might enjoy a stroll around [Lower Yosemite Falls](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Mariposa%20County,%20CA,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.746020,-119.596009&name=Lower%20Yosemite%20Fall%20Trail&place-id=I9FFF01D4D8EAEDFE&map=explore).
* üì∑ My favorite view of the Valley is [Tunnel View](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Wawona%20Rd,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.715586,-119.676926&name=Tunnel%20View&place-id=I7408F9590EC1AB75&map=explore). This spot is always crowded, even at sunrise.
* üì∑ For a little less of a crowd, we learned about [Rostrum Point](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Wawona%20Rd,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.716580,-119.705879&name=Wawona%20Road%20Pullout&place-id=I8461C76F6E6DEA0A&map=explore), a small pullout on the other side of the tunnel. If you hike out slightly, you‚Äôll find some amazing views of Half Dome--with much less of a crowd.
