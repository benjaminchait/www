Yosemite National Park is a special place. It’s one of the most unique landscapes, and full of icons like Half Dome. The Yosemite Valley is magical, but the park itself is full of wilderness. And on a personal note, Cara and I [got married in the park](/archives/yosemite-wedding)!

### Yosemite Valley
* 🏞️ The [Yosemite Valley](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Southside%20Dr%20%26%20Yosemite%20Valley%20Loop%20Trail,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=9902249752144429275&ll=37.737225,-119.604077&lsp=9902&q=Yosemite%20Valley) itself is extraordinary. You’re surrounded by granite cliffs a few thousand feet tall, and the Merced River runs down the center. This makes a lovely spot for an in-park lodge stay, and offers a number of amenities and dining options.
* 🏨 [The Ahwahnee Hotel](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1%20Ahwahnee%20Dr,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=16197676400918435143&ll=37.746218,-119.574310&lsp=9902&q=The%20Ahwahnee%20Hotel) is described as a crown jewel of park lodges. It sits in the valley a short walk from Yosemite Falls, and is a beautiful spot in which to take in the park.
* 🥩 [The Mountain Room Restaurant](https://maps.apple.com/?address=9006%20Yosemite%20Lodge%20Dr,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=2370034411666224560&ll=37.743527,-119.598115&lsp=9902&q=Mountain%20Room%20Restaurant) is a great spot for a nice, relatively casual meal located at the Yosemite Valley Lodge.
* 🍕 For a more relaxed meal, the [Curry Village Pizza Deck](https://maps.apple.com/?address=9010%20Curry%20Village%20Service%20Rd,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=12542205084086810426&ll=37.737365,-119.571317&lsp=9902&q=Curry%20Village%20Pizza%20Deck) has delightful wood-fired pizzas and lots of outdoor patio tables to enjoy an evening meal.
* 🥾 Go for a morning hike up the [Mist Trail](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Mariposa%20County,%20CA,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.726266,-119.530570&name=Mist%20Trail&place-id=I25571980EDFF8691&map=explore). This trail is quite popular, so start early to avoid the crowds! Fortunately, this trail is relatively easy--it does have a number of steps (to get to the top of some waterfalls) but is one of the shorter hikes.
* 🥾 For more of a challenge, try hiking to the top of [Yosemite Falls](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Mariposa%20County,%20CA,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.742811,-119.603290&name=Upper%20Yosemite%20Falls%20Trail&place-id=I6045CC472F070161&map=explore). This trail is very dusty and steep! But your views of the Valley are lovely once you reach the top!
* 🌲 Anyone in your group who doesn’t want the challenge might enjoy a stroll around [Lower Yosemite Falls](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Mariposa%20County,%20CA,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.746020,-119.596009&name=Lower%20Yosemite%20Fall%20Trail&place-id=I9FFF01D4D8EAEDFE&map=explore).
* 🛶 Rafting along the Merced River is a delightful leisurely activity.
* 📷 My favorite view of the Valley is [Tunnel View](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Wawona%20Rd,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.715586,-119.676926&name=Tunnel%20View&place-id=I7408F9590EC1AB75&map=explore). This spot is always crowded, even at sunrise.
* 📷 For a little less of a crowd, we learned about [Rostrum Point](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Wawona%20Rd,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.716580,-119.705879&name=Wawona%20Road%20Pullout&place-id=I8461C76F6E6DEA0A&map=explore), a small pullout on the other side of the tunnel. If you hike out slightly, you’ll find some amazing views of Half Dome--with much less of a crowd.
* 🏞️ Some of the best views of the Valley come from [Glacier Point](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Four%20Mile%20Trail,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.729807,-119.573320&name=Glacier%20Point&place-id=ICF2B4D5FA97B777D&map=transit). You can choose to hike from the Valley or drive.
* 🥾 If you’re driving to Glacier Point, you’ll pass [Sentinel Dome](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Glacier%20Point%20Rd,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.712373,-119.586627&name=Sentinel%20Dome%20and%20Taft%20Point%20Trailhead&place-id=IB6A20BE2DE615F70&map=transit) a mile or two before the parking area. This tends to be less crowded, and gives you a chance to hike atop one of the park’s many domed rocks.

### Yosemite wilderness
* 💦 While not quite wilderness, [Tenaya Lake](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Mariposa%20County,%20CA,%20United%20States&auid=1620624891433443957&coordinate=37.830490,-119.463018&lsp=9902&name=Tenaya%20Lake&map=explore) is where Cara and I got married. It’s quite peaceful, and far from the crowds of the valley.
* 🏞️ [Olmsted Point](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Snow%20Creek%20Trail,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.810598,-119.485518&name=Olmsted%20Point&place-id=I48DA619DC25FE5B6&map=explore) is in the high country and affords some lovely views of Half Dome. We’ve often stopped here for a snack or a meal (bring your own food!) on our way toward a backpacking adventure.
* 💦 A great getaway in the true backcountry is [Young Lakes](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Tuolumne%20County,%20CA,%20United%20States&auid=17560323795179546455&coordinate=37.936184,-119.346729&lsp=9902&name=Young%20Lakes&map=explore) starting from [Tuolumne Meadows](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Pacific%20Crest%20National%20Scenic%20Trail,%20Groveland,%20CA%20%2095321,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.876893,-119.345725&name=Tuolumne%20Meadows%20Wilderness%20Center&place-id=I7CF773782A0CC830&map=explore).
* 💦 My first backpacking adventure in Yosemite was to [Chilnualna Falls](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Chilnualna%20Creek,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.563375,-119.617158&name=Chilnualna%20Falls&place-id=I6FFD5A5CBEC482FA&map=explore) starting from [Wawona](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Chilnualna%20Falls%20Trail,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.548663,-119.633580&name=Chilnualna%20Falls%20Trailhead&place-id=IB13339778CC5515C&map=explore).

### Not quite wilderness
* 🌲 Yosemite is home to multiple sequoia (redwood tree) groves. The [Mariposa Grove](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Perimeter%20Trail,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.515344,-119.600321&name=Mariposa%20Grove&place-id=IABEB150CBD343ED0&map=explore) is magnificent and the largest, but the [Tuolumne Grove](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Tuolumne%20Grove%20Loop%20Trail,%20Groveland,%20CA%20%2095321,%20United%20States&coordinate=37.768786,-119.806068&name=Tuolumne%20Grove&place-id=IB3E463B332AF567&map=explore) is quite special as well.
