Yosemite National Park is a special place. It‚Äôs one of the most unique landscapes, and full of icons like Half Dome. The Yosemite Valley is magical, but the park itself is full of wilderness.

### Yosemite Valley
* üèûÔ∏è The [Yosemite Valley](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Southside%20Dr%20%26%20Yosemite%20Valley%20Loop%20Trail,%20Yosemite%20National%20Park,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=9902249752144429275&ll=37.737225,-119.604077&lsp=9902&q=Yosemite%20Valley) itself is extraordinary. You‚Äôre surrounded by granite cliffs a few thousand feet tall, and the Merced River runs down the center. This makes a lovely spot for an in-park lodge stay, and offers a number of amenities and dining options.
* üè® [The Ahwahnee Hotel](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1%20Ahwahnee%20Dr,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=16197676400918435143&ll=37.746218,-119.574310&lsp=9902&q=The%20Ahwahnee%20Hotel) is described as a crown jewel of park lodges. It sits in the valley a short walk from Yosemite Falls, and is a beautiful spot in which to take in the park.
* ü•© [The Mountain Room Restaurant](https://maps.apple.com/?address=9006%20Yosemite%20Lodge%20Dr,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=2370034411666224560&ll=37.743527,-119.598115&lsp=9902&q=Mountain%20Room%20Restaurant) is a great spot for a nice, relatively casual meal located at the Yosemite Valley Lodge.
* üçï For a more relaxed meal, the [Curry Village Pizza Deck](https://maps.apple.com/?address=9010%20Curry%20Village%20Service%20Rd,%20Coulterville,%20CA%20%2095389,%20United%20States&auid=12542205084086810426&ll=37.737365,-119.571317&lsp=9902&q=Curry%20Village%20Pizza%20Deck) has delightful wood-fired pizzas and lots of outdoor patio tables to enjoy an evening meal.
