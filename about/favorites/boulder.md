_Last updated 22 June 2025._

I was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado; this is my hometown! And while I have not lived here in years, I visit family and friends often.

- ☕️ [Boxcar Coffee Roasters](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1825%20Pearl%20St,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=8835420102125326547&ll=40.019823,-105.271473&lsp=9902&q=Boxcar%20Coffee%20Roasters) is my favorite coffee spot. They’re a great set of humans, and both the pastries and the coffee is excellent.
- 🥯 Grab a breakfast bagel from [Moe’s Broadway Bagel](https://maps.apple.com/?address=3075%20Arapahoe%20Ave,%20Boulder,%20CO%2080303,%20United%20States&auid=11452497518359192385&ll=40.015027,-105.252007&lsp=9902&q=Moe's%20Broadway%20Bagel) and find a nice spot outdoors to enjoy (eg. Chautauqua Park or the Boulder Creek).
- 🥪 If it’s lunch, grab a sandwich from [Dish Gourmet](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1918%20Pearl%20St,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=14001950911578857009&ll=40.019697,-105.270096&lsp=9902&q=Dish%20Gourmet) and enjoy someplace along Pearl Street or downtown.
- 🥘 [Sherpa’s](https://maps.apple.com/?address=825%20Walnut%20St,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=3124829576012812634&ll=40.016143,-105.284432&lsp=9902&q=Sherpa's%20Adventure%20Restaurant%20%26%20Bar) has delicious Nepalese-style food.
- 🍕 For some happy hour pizza, appetizers, and drinks, visit [Pizzeria Alberico](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1730%20Pearl%20St,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=16623498063454463912&ll=40.019135,-105.272542&lsp=9902&q=Pizzeria%20Alberico) and sit at the bar or on the outside patio!
- 🌮 [The Rio](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1101%20Walnut%20St,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=7232455307254972357&ll=40.016777,-105.280824&lsp=9902&q=Rio%20Grande%20Mexican%20Restaurant)’s margaritas are world-famous.
- 🍣 [Hapa](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1117%20Pearl%20Street,%20Boulder,%20CO%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=14715943169855714467&ll=40.017865,-105.280919&lsp=9902&q=Hapa%20Sushi%20Grill%20and%20Sake%20Bar) is an excellent sushi spot, which seems odd considering Boulder is landlocked ... but it’s amazing.
- 🍻 Pub drinks from the [Mountain Sun](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1535%20Pearl%20St,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=14474637385343172249&ll=40.019019,-105.275209&lsp=9902&q=Mountain%20Sun%20Pub%20%26%20Brewery) is always fun, but last I checked they were cash-only.
- 🍻 For more craft brews, visit [Upslope](https://maps.apple.com/?address=1501%20Lee%20Hill%20Rd,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080304,%20United%20States&auid=17332624768728670828&ll=40.062901,-105.279240&lsp=9902&q=Upslope%20Brewing%20Company), [Sanitas](https://maps.apple.com/?address=3550%20Frontier%20Ave,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080301,%20United%20States&auid=2361003309779870754&ll=40.022100,-105.248319&lsp=9902&q=Sanitas), or [Avery](https://maps.apple.com/?address=4910%20Nautilus%20Ct%20N,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080301,%20United%20States&auid=16656827806794431938&ll=40.062524,-105.204736&lsp=9902&q=Avery%20Brewing%20Co) (as a bonus, Avery happens to have food and a brewery tour).
- 👨‍🎤 Find a show at the [Boulder Theatre](https://maps.apple.com/?address=2032%2014th%20St,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=4387618948551568433&ll=40.019131,-105.277195&lsp=9902&q=Boulder%20Theater) -- my favorite was the Warren Miller annual film release.
- 🥾 Get outside and hike around at [Chautauqua](https://maps.apple.com/?address=900%20Baseline%20Rd,%20Boulder,%20CO%20%2080302,%20United%20States&auid=3328881260573032957&ll=39.998886,-105.281031&lsp=9902&q=Chautauqua%20Park) or some of the many miles of Open Space & Mountain Parks trails.
