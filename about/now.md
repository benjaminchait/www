🏝 I am currently enjoying a _personal sabbatical_ and getting to explore and enjoy a new home base (👋 hello Chicago!) while considering what I want for my next adventure.

👨‍💻 I’m accepting a limited number of consulting roles, primarily focused on early-stage organizations exploring digital product development. If that sounds like something we might chat about, [let’s chat](https://calendly.com/benjaminchait/30min)?
