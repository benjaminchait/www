This year wasn’t what I expected.

The first part of this year was rebuilding. Lyra joined the family, the basement was fixed.

The second part of this year was personal. Tough conversations, and decisions which still feel raw.

The last part of the year has been sorting: what next?

I’m exhausted. But I’m optimistic, and looking toward the future.
