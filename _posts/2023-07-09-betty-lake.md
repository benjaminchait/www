We visited Colorado for my birthday and the holiday weekend, and planned a two-night backpacking trek in Indian Peaks Wilderness on the King Lake Trail. Sadly, snow conditions higher up made crossing a pass to get to our second night’s campground challenging; and Lyra seemed to have injured her paw (or hind leg) so we made the choice to return after one night at Betty Lake. That said, it was beautiful and quiet - we were the only backpackers there, and I’m reminded how much I miss the mountains.

The rest of the week was spent in Boulder, visiting my parents and hiking about town.
