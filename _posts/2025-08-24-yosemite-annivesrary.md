We celebrated our first [wedding](/archives/yosemite-wedding) anniversary by returning to Yosemite National Park, this time with friends and a puppy.

We camped in the Valley, played in the Merced river, enjoyed stories by the campfire, watched sunrise at Tunnel View, picnicked at Lake Tenaya, and enjoyed time in the most magical of places. 

Having a puppy is different—the ranger reminded us that Luna needed to keep her “paws on pavement” (aka no trails, nothing in the backcountry)—but even with that constraint, it was joyful to be back in Sierras. Sharing this special place with friends, and creating more memories in the mountains, felt like a glimpse of the years ahead—returning again and again, with new family members, new stories, and the same enduring beauty of Yosemite.
