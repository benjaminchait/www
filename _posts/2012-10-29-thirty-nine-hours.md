Some 39 hours following our initial flight from DEN to SEA, [Sarah][1] and I arrived in Bangkok, Thailand approximately 12:30 am local time.

We were incredibly fortunate to have a place to crash in Seattle with college friends; enjoying a 16-hour layover in the Pacific Northwest with good food, some rain and a kitten.

Flying from Seattle to Beijing was fascinating as we circumnavigated northbound flying over Alaska and Russia; though 12 hours on a plane is exhausting.

A three-hour layover in Beijing was spent passing China customs and immigration and getting lost searching for the international checkin counter. Following that was a final flight, this one five hours in length landing in Bangkok just past midnight. A taxi ride to a family friend&#8217;s home and our travels were concluded 2 am.

Made it.
