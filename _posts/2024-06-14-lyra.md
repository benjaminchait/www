I feel as if a part of me is gone forever.

My silly, goofy girl. My best friend. My fierce, loyal companion. My adventure buddy. The joy and light of my life.

Lyra came into my world after an [unexpected and sudden loss](/archives/kippa). I wasn‚Äôt ready for another pup. But then Lyra arrived home, and she helped fill a hole in my life. She helped me to heal. To learn that I could give all my love, all over again. She was so special.

More than anything, Lyra was a part of me. She was born in Colorado, near my parents. She grew up in Oregon, where I‚Äôd lived for many years. She and I explored California together, moving to SF and enduring both startups and COVID. And she again moved, this time to Illinois where she‚Äôd encounter and love her favorite snowy weather in Chicago. My past few years have been a sea of change, but Lyra was my constant companion.

Lyra represented her namesake, the protagonist in Philip Pullman‚Äôs series ‚ÄúHis Dark Materials‚Äù: stubborn, headstrong, kind. And similar to that fictional world, Lyra herself became my very own d√¶mon: she would follow me everywhere, just hanging out by my side while I worked from home. She‚Äôd jump up the moment my laptop closed for the day. The sight of a leash or harness inspired great joy, and many excited barks. She was also incredibly stubborn. As many friends would learn, Lyra was eager to start a walk ‚Ä¶ and very happy to park herself on the ground if ever she wanted to extend the outside adventure. She knew it was difficult to move a 100-lbs pup who was rolling on her back, and she‚Äôd make a game out of it, coaxing treats and attention in return for continuing on a few more steps!

This silly pup made new friends with ease. Her friendly and silly demeanor allowed her to waltz up to a stranger and sit on their feet while seeking pets and affection. While living in Portland, our walks would often take us right past a local brewery. Whenever Lyra would spot a group of humans enjoying a beverage, she‚Äôd pull the leash and plop onto the ground encouraging someone to give her a belly rub ‚Äî and would not allow me to continue the walk until she‚Äôd said hello and made friends with everyone in the group. She also loved saying hello to other pups and small humans, even if they barked at her or pulled at her fur.

She was my steadfast companion when the world turned upside down. We‚Äôd moved to San Francisco not six months before the pandemic, and suddenly we were to ‚Äòshelter in place.‚Äô Our daily walks on Russian Hill brought us fresh air and kept us sane, even if we couldn‚Äôt say our usual hellos to other humans or pups. Cara was gracious and kind and encouraged the pup to join us backpacking, and so Lyra embraced her mountain dog heritage ‚Äî bounding up and down trails, always stopping to smell the flowers, but never willing to step into a mountain lake. (She had the silliest little leap to jump over puddles on the sidewalk, never wanting to get her paws wet. Yet she was also a stubborn goof, always happy to hang in the pitter-patter of the rain.)

Moving to Chicago meant leaving the mountains and most of our friends and family. But Lyra gained the best, snowiest winters. She was and always will be a mountain dog ‚Äî often refusing to return indoors, preferring to enjoy the snow-filled yard.

And then, unexpectedly, she was sick. Lyra was [diagnosed with cancer](/archives/fuck-cancer). She started chemo. We learned a new routine, full of medications and vet visits. Lyra had some good days, including celebrating her [half birthday](/archives/half-birthday)! But the past week saw a marked decline; and signs that her cancer was progressing rapidly and aggressively. We elected to pause chemo, and began to focus on Lyra‚Äôs quality of life. A short time later, we said goodbye while at home, surrounded by her family.

Six-and-a-half years is far too few. I‚Äôm heartbroken, again, too soon.
