Building community is important to me. Whether we live together in a neighborhood, the same city, within a single state, in a country or merely on this same earth &#8212; our lives are connected. We (hopefully) spend our daytime hours working alongside like-minded individuals toward a common goal.

When moving to Portland, I sought out to build a new community and group of friends. I’m fortunate to have met and been invited to help support the folks who organize TEDxPortland. Last Saturday was my third event in the Rose City, and the team’s sixth year: TEDxPortland 2016. Our hope was to inspire, and celebrate, this amazing area which we call home.

Today, the city and region are changing fast. Growth is exciting, and brings with it new challenges. I’m here to participate, and to build a better place.
