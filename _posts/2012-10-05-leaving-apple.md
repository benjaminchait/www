Few words can convey my feelings as I reflect upon my time with Apple. I have been afforded unparalleled opportunities, worked with amazing people and have myself grown as a result.

Working at Apple, we often speak about our impact upon others. Less often described is the impact that Apple has upon us: without question, it has shaped the person I am today. When I consider who I was when I began and who I am today, I recognize the countless lifelong skills learned during my journey including deliberateness and intentionality. And certainly I have had my share of opportunities, but with those challenges have come many successes. I am incredibly thankful for the privilege of a lifetime.

While I feel bittersweet in saying goodbye, I know my time has been spent well. A year ago I found myself walking past a quote written on a wall inside Infinite Loop 4 immediately across from Town Hall:

> “I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.”   
> — Steve Jobs

Looking forward, not backward.
