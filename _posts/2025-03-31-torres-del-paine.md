We visited southern Chile for a small getaway and trek in Torres del Paine National Park!

Our flights took us to Puerto Natales, a small tourist town on the edge of a fjord; where we spent a few nights getting settled and enjoying activities during the day. This was my first time in South America, and surprisingly my first visit to a Spanish-speaking country.

For our first adventure, we booked a puma trek. This region has the highest density of pumas (aka “cougars” aka “mountain lions”) of anyplace on earth. A guide picked us up at our hotel before dawn and drove us north toward the park. Upon arrival, we watched sunrise and the first light on the “torres” (“towers”). And almost immediately, our guide (in collaboration with other trackers) announced they’d spotted a set of pumas - and we were off! Puma tracking is nearly entirely in a car or along the road, with binoculars or a spotting scope. But after a short bit, this particular puma named Petaka decided to walk right through the crowd of onlookers and took a stroll down the road with her cubs.

A short bit later, we got to follow another puma named Amarga who similarly wandered down the road, ignoring what our guide nicknamed the “puma paparazzi.”

In total, we saw six pumas - many of them stunningly up-close!

The next day we’d booked a horseback ride through an “estancia” (“farm” or “ranch” land). We spent hours with some beautiful horses and some lovely guides, learning about Patagonia and seeing the beginning of the fall colors take hold of the landscape.

Then came our O Trek in the national park. We trekked from Séron to Dickson to Los Perros to Grey to Cuernos to Central. The first day was uneventful, but some rain and strong winds arrived on day two. We were very grateful having purchased meals, and enjoyed the company of other trekkers. Our third day brought us to Los Perros through a very muddy and wet trail.

From here, we were told the next morning’s departure was required before 07:00 in order to cross a mountain pass and make it down to the next camp (Grey) in a timely manner; so Cara and I started in the dark. We quickly encountered snow - and at sunrise saw the valley had been blanketed in white powder which fell overnight! (Some of the mountaintops are always covered in snow, but we later found other trekkers who’d completed the pass a day before us and had walked on bare rock the whole way!) Also, the winds were no joke: with my full pack, I could lean entirely into the wind and not fall!

Crossing John Gardner Pass was not easy, but upon reaching the top we were rewarded with a fantastic view of Grey Glacier. This view continued for much of the afternoon and the hike down the western edge and was a spectacular sight both due to Grey’s enormity as well as the vivid and deep glacial blues.

The route from Grey to Cuernos to Central was in much better condition (and had many more trekkers) as this is where the O Trek overlaps the W Trek. After an exhausting crossing of the pass and a long day to reach our next camp, we skipped the French Valley; but the scenery along our trail was lovely.

On our final day, we left our big packs at camp and departed around 03:35 to hike to the base of the towers for sunrise. With only our headlamps to light the way, we were thankfully unaware of the ascent - and simply kept focused on the next step. As we arrived at Mirador Las Torres the first hint of sun began to reflect on the white snow, showing a deep and dark red unlike anything I’ve ever encountered. As light began to fill the valley, the towers were covered in an astounding pink - a fun bookend to our trip, having seen the colorful sunrise from afar while on our puma trek.

We hiked down, enjoying the magical colors of the landscape; and enjoyed some celebratory beers while waiting for our bus out of the park.

I think this was the hardest trek I’ve ever completed, maybe in part due to the weather conditions. Our trip was during the final few days of the season (with the O Trek “closed” after March) and included more rain and wind (and snow) than we had anticipated. But at the same time, it was absolutely stunning. I’m not sure when we’ll have the time to make it back that far south, but I am very much looking forward to a future visit to these incredible landscapes.
