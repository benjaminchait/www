The sun came out after a rainy morning, one last warm glow in 2016. Not quite cold, though not quite the warm California weather we were expecting. Rather, hoping.&nbsp;

Looking outward, the past year has been rough. But personally, 2016 was good. Kippa joined our family, Sarah was admitted into (and accepted) a graduate program and we continued to explore and enjoy the Pacific Northwest. We’ve made new friends, and become more active in our community.&nbsp;

I also accomplished two small, silly goals I set for myself one year ago: practice French and post a photo every day. (Being a leap year, I succeeded in both of these 366 times.) By no means am I fluent, nor a professional photographer; instead, I’m feeling more confident, and making practice a part of my routine. Small habits are hard to build, but I’m excited to have proven I can.&nbsp;

I’m not quite sure what 2017 will look like. I’m more anxious today than I was this time last year. But I’m also fortunate to have friends and family with me in this journey.&nbsp;
