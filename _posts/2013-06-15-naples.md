Naples was not my favorite place but I got to eat pizza Margherita where the dish was invented. The parents departed for home and Tye stayed to travel for the next few weeks. Our first stop in southern Italy includes beautiful coastal waters, views of Mount Vesuvius and a dirty, graffiti-laden city—I’m glad to depart.
