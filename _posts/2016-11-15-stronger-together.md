I still have hope.

I believe that we can build a better future. That our communities can be stronger. That we can find those values which unite us, and to prove that we are better-off collaborating, building up one-another.

During my lifetime, I believe that the United States will elect a woman to the highest office. I believe we will learn to celebrate our differences, whether in beliefs or backgrounds or experiences. I believe kindness will prevail.

Before that, though, we have this. We have a lot of work ahead of us. I have fears about the next four years.

But I still believe that love trumps hate.
