This small backpacker town with some 2,200 residents is quite simply fantastic. Tucked in the northern mountains, it greets one with a perfect mix of cool evenings and warm tropical days. Also, lots of rain. The two main roads close each night creating a strolling market; yet scooters constantly scramble through the crowd. A few minutes walk beyond town and one finds bungalows, countryside and farming. The commotion of our previous two cities behind us, we hop amongst the caf√©s and used bookstores lining the streets. Reading and writing fill quiet afternoons.

Thailand: Bangkok < Chiang Mai < Pai.
