I’m sitting with my grandmother. It’s on me for not visiting during the past two years, but I’m here now. She asks about my future plans; listens as I describe stories from abroad; and shares her love and excitement for my next adventures.

Just a week ago, I was driving along an empty mountain road on Colorado’s front range. Snow began falling just after midnight, both picturesque and quieting.

Memories are beautiful and complex and tragic. While old memories are fast becoming fleeting, I aspire to leave a few new ones.

I sometimes find myself wishing that growing up were less challenging. This is a part of life; I’m struggling with acceptance. I never expected visiting my grandmother would be this challenging. Family frequently suggested I make this trip; it took far too long, but I&#8217;m glad I made it.

I have so very much for which to be thankful. More than anything, I am thankful to have such an amazingly supportive family. I am fortunate to have returned safely from travels. And to share this journey with an incredible partner, Sarah.
