Grace, Sarahâ€™s younger sister, joined us in Oregon for the summer.

Sarah and I attended a wedding, and XOXO 2016. I flew back to support TEDxBoulder 2016.

And in the midst of that, Kippa joined the family.

[Kippa][1]. She is a delight. Sarah flew to Colorado to pick-up our pup at eight weeks old; she weighed thirteen pounds the last few days of June. About a week ago, at five months old, our little puppy is over fifty pounds! So many stories, and many more photographs.

Finding time to write is challenging; so many competing priorities day-to-day. Trying to get back into the swing of it.

But really, spending time where it matters. Like with my parents as they visited for the weekend, and got to meet the pup for the first time!
