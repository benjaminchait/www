A European vacation, a wedding in Tuscany, and adventuring in new places.

A night in Rome to start. Gelato and pizza.

Florence for a day, seeing art and drinking wine.

Tuscany for a few days, with family and friends.

A day trip to the Cinque Terra. (It was a bit of a drive, but well worth it.)

Bologna and Modena.

Como and Milano. Seeing an old friend.

Athens. The Acropolis. So much history. And a final few days with my parents.
