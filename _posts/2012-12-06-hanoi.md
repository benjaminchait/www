Ancient meets modern. History crossing present. Asia encapsulating Europe.

Capital of modern-day Vietnam and home to fantastic food, the past week has been spent enjoying Hanoi. History is evident with every step you take through the rainy city. The Temple of Literature, Vietnam’s first university, stands apart from the streets around it; built in 1070, it sits amid modern cafés and the bustling traffic. Memorials to Ho Chi Minh celebrate his impact, constant reminders of the current government’s relative youth. Enjoying bún and coffee in the Old Quarter, admiring architecture in the French Quarter and quiet strolls around Hoan Kiem Lake showcase both the influence of numerous occupations and the native culture’s resilience.
