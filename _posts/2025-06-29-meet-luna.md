Yesterday we brought home a new member of the family: Luna, an eight-week-old Bernese Mountain Dog.

We’d been on a waitlist for almost a year when we learned a litter was born and we could adopt a pup. The complication: We were moving, and the litter was in Illinois. So after spending the past week making the trek back west, we flew back to Chicago and rented a car; spent an evening in southern Illinois; and met and brought this little one back to Berkeley yesterday on her first (and likely only!) flight. It’s a lot both for us and for her, but we’re so thrilled to have this furry friend in our lives.
