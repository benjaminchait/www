Exploring Kyoto these past three days involved running between a mere few of the many temples spread throughout the city. In the last few days in Tokyo, Sarah&#8217;s friend Ibis joined us traveling Japan; arriving in Kyoto we met Chris, an old friend of mine teaching English in the south. And while he noted that &#8220;you can never see everything in Kyoto,&#8221; we were determined to see as much as we could.

Falling snow balanced against sunlight provided an incredible backdrop as we traversed through Kyoto&#8217;s history, enjoying a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) and good company.
