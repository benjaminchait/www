Exploring Kyoto these past three days involved running between a mere few of the many temples spread throughout the city. In the last few days in Tokyo, Sarah’s friend Ibis joined us traveling Japan; arriving in Kyoto we met Chris, an old friend of mine teaching English in the south. And while he noted that “you can never see everything in Kyoto,” we were determined to see as much as we could.

Falling snow balanced against sunlight provided an incredible backdrop as we traversed through Kyoto’s history, enjoying a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) and good company.
