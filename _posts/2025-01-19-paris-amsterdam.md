Similar to [last year](/archives/paris-in-january), Cara and I returned to Paris earlier this month. While she taught a study abroad course, my time was filled with art, baguettes, croissants, walking, and wine. We only had a week due to this year’s schedule, but we made it to Amsterdam for an evening (and to see a friend). And our final evening in Paris brought us to dinner with another friend of mine, who happened to be on holiday as well.
