I’m grateful.

So much is happening—and changing—in my world right now, it feels like a blur. We sold [our Chicago home](/archives/chicago). Drove west to return to the Bay Area. Got the keys to our new place and immediately flew back to Illinois [to adopt Luna](/archives/meet-luna). Our new spot is relatively empty, our belongings in transit someplace between the midwest and the Pacific. Everything feels transitional.

The next few months will be a bit of chaos as we settle into new routines, new jobs, a new place. All the challenges that come with moving our lives.

And yet, I’m surrounded by community. People I’ve known for years, from school and previous jobs. Family, friends, friends of friends. Good humans working to lift-up one-another.

My past year started full of sadness and loss, and grew into something far more complex. I encountered my share of challenges, plenty of uncertainty and change—but those moments made way for some incredible adventures and memories. I’m reminded that life is short, and we ought to embrace every moment.

I’m grateful for where I’ve been, and for the journey that’s still to come.
