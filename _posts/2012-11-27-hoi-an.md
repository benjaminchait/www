The more time I spend in Hoi An, the more I enjoy this small town. Midway up the coast, it&#8217;s an odd mix of old and new. Shopkeepers line the streets outside his or her respective shop, each repeating vaguely, &#8220;Hello, come buy from me?&#8221; This week has been a small test in managing expectations and avoiding disappointment. Delightful food and enjoyable sights exist, assuming one finds the cultural gems among the selling.

Fantastic landscapes adorn the eleven-hour train ride getting here.

As a minor port, the riverfront defines the landscape with historic sites sprinkled throughout the town. The fusion of Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese cultures is ever-present.

The Marble Mountains are some 20 kilometers north, a short motorbike rental away. The temples line the mountains cliffs, caves weaving into the limestone.

Tomorrow we head north on another train, this time ending in Hanoi.
