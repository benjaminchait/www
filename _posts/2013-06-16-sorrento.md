Along the southern coast, Sorrento offers clear, blue water as it meets black-sand beaches among the many hillsides and cliffs. Lemon groves exist in troves surrounding this 16,000-person town. Beautiful, quiet and relaxing, our one-day visit concluded with a delightful meal—at a small, family-run trattoria—and was capped with the town’s specialty, limoncello.
