We’ve had four years in Chicago. Before we made the move, we’d spent only a few days in the city combined, and weren’t sure what to expect. In so many ways, it’s been so very good to us. But tomorrow we’re headed back west, heading toward some new adventures.

It’s bittersweet. Our community here, our friends and colleagues, have been wonderful. We’ve made so many memories, lived so much life—both bad and good. I’ll miss it.

On to the next chapter.
