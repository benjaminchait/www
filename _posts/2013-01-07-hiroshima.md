Heading south via Shinkansen we arrived in Hiroshima. The magnitude of its history is tremendous; as humans we created unimaginable destruction. I found myself speechless walking through Peace Park and visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. And yet, in this city which witnessed the incomprehensible, there exists a constant refrain of forgiveness and hope, of looking toward the future.

Yesterday&#8217;s day-trip to Hakata via Shinkansen included my favorite bowl of ramen with our evening dinner in Kokura containing raw horse. Today&#8217;s ferry trip to Miyajima near sunset provided an impressive sight of the Itsukushima Shinto Shrine torii in the water. With each stop in Japan, I am more inspired by the history and depth of culture which exists.
