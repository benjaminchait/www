Last weekend we took a three-day trip into the Boundary Waters in northern Minnesota just outside of Ely and went 🛶 canoe camping for a few nights.

This was my first multi-day trip on a canoe, and it was such a fun experience. Unlike backpacking, we could carry our tent and food in the canoe with us. “Portaging” the canoe over land was new, and it was pretty easy when the wind wasn’t blowing (as the canoe acted like a giant sail).

We paddled along some amazing rivers and lakes, and saw plenty of wildlife like bald eagles and beavers. Evening stars were bright, the Milky Way was visible. We heard the wolves howling early in the morning. While we encountered a few humans — especially at the portages — it was peaceful, quiet, and magical.
