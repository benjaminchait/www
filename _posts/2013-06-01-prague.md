A Czech bartender approaches and begins to rattle off what I can only imagine are the evening’s offerings only to pause some five seconds into his speech when he looks at us and—having now switched to English—asks, “You don’t speak Czech, do you?” Returning a few minutes later, he placed before us half-liter glasses with draught beer as we enjoyed the rainy evening indoors.

Three days in Prague were filled with good food, great beer, new friends, exploring castles, amazing architecture, cobblestone streets, relaxing in parks, misty mornings and beautiful riverside walks.
