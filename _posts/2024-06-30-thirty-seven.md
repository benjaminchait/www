I feel like you’re meant to celebrate on your birthday, but the past few weeks have been full of heartbreak. I’m still healing, and taking it day-by-day.

A few thoughts about what matters to me, right now -
# Find joy in everyday moments.
# Cultivate experiences and create memories; say yes whenever possible.
# Do your best, every single day. 
# Leave this place better than you found it.
# Share stories.
# Be kind.
