Cara and I recently invited our family to visit our favorite place and to celebrate with us in üèûÔ∏è [Yosemite National Park](/about/favorites/yosemite). Our National Park Service permit allowed us a small wedding ceremony at Tenaya Lake; we enjoyed sharing this wonderful place with our parents, siblings, and their families.

We also found an amazing photographic pair ‚Äî [Shawn Reeder and Brittany Colt](https://yosemiteweddingphotography.com) ‚Äî who did fantastic work and captured all these moments so we could share them:
