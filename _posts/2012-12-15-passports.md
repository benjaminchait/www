I have my passport back, finally. For most of the past four weeks I&#8217;ve only seen it intermittently. Not a single night has passed during which I&#8217;ve held it, physically. But that&#8217;s normal in Vietnam.

Unlike anyplace I have previously visited, Vietnamese law requires your lodging to hold your passport while you stay. It&#8217;s a part of checking-in at each new place and I needed to remind myself to ask for its return with each check-out. Even after a month, it feels weird to hand over such an important document.

Traveling with a United States passport is a privilege. Visa requirements are kinder perhaps only to citizens of the United Kingdom with its extensive map of former colonies. Researching entry regulations across SE Asia and the Pacific, I am amazed at how many places provide us a visa upon arrival. Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan and New Zealand have no pre-arrival expectations other than a departure plan; Australia is an online submission for an Electronic Transfer Authority -mine was approved instantly, providing entry for the next year. Thus far, only Vietnam has required an actual visa in advance-and that requirement holds true for most foreign visitor. Still, one out of the first six stops makes this process incredibly simple.

I feel slightly exposed without my passport while abroad. It is effectively my only form of identification while traveling save my driver&#8217;s license. Beyond that, it also serves as my means to travel; without it, I can cross no borders. Relinquishing it still feels weird and I am glad to have it back after checking-out of my final stop in Vietnam.
